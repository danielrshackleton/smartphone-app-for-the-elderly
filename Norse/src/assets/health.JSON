            "advice":"Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or eating foods. \n\nThe adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance person is allergic to (allergen). \n\nDuring anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and may swell, obstructing their airway.\n\nCall 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock.\n\nCheck if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe.\n\nYou can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to do so, give it to them yourself.\n\nAfter the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives.\n\nAll casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. \n\nMake sure they're comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. \n\nIf they're conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them."

            "advice":"If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock. \n\nFirst, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. \n\nIf you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. \n\nCheck that there's nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. \n\nInstead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. \n\nIf nothing is embedded: \n\n\u2022 Apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible. Continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops. \n\n\u2022 Use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly. \n\n\u2022 If bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound until the bleeding stops, and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place. Do not remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped. \n\nIf a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film. Do not wash the severed limb.\n\nWrap the package in soft fabric and place in a container of crushed ice. Do not let the limb touch the ice. \n\nMake sure the severed limb goes with the patient to hospital. \n\nAlways seek medical help for bleeding, unless it's minor."

If cling film isn't available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material. Do not wrap the burn tightly as swelling may lead to further injury.\n\n\u2022 Do not apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn.\n\nFor chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to remove the chemical.\n\nIf possible, determine the cause of the injury.\n\nIn certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use.\n\nBe careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary.\n\nCall 999 or 112 for immediate medical help."

            "advice":"If choking is severe, the person won't be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they'll eventually become unconscious. \n\nTo help an adult or child over 1 year old: \n\n\u2022 Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with 1 hand. Lean the person forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. \n\n\u2022 Give up to 5 sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). \n\n\u2022 Check if the blockage has cleared. \n\n\u2022 If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts. \n\nDo not give abdominal thrusts to babies under 1 year old or to pregnant women. \n\nTo perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn't in one of the above groups: \n\n\u2022 Stand behind the person who is choking. \n\n\u2022 Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. \n\n\u2022 Clench 1 fist and place it just above the person's belly button. \n\n\u2022 Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. \n\n\u2022 Repeat this up to 5 times. \n\nThe aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all 5. \n\n If the person's airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts: \n\n\u2022 Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the 999 operator that the person is choking. \n\n\u2022 Continue with the cycles of 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until help arrives. \n\nThe person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain."

If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone.\n\nIf the person is unconscious or is bleeding heavily, these must be dealt with first by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. See the section on bleeding on this page.\n\nIf the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital.\n\nOnce you have done this, decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car.\n\nIf the pain isn't too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. Get someone else to drive if possible so you can care for the casualty during the trip.\n\nBut call 999 if:\n\n\u2022 they're in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication – call an ambulance and do not move them\n\n\u2022 it's obvious they have a broken leg – do not move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance\n\n\u2022 you suspect they have injured or broken their back – call an ambulance and do not move them\n\nDo not give the casualty anything to eat or drink as they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital."

The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.\n\nIf they do vomit naturally, try to collect some of it for the ambulance crew – this may help identify the cause of the poisoning.\n\nIf the patient is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and keep checking they're breathing normally."
